In this project, I will include project 1, 2 and 3. I will also include a personal project where I drew and designed 4 outfits for some OC's (including one of my own) for a music thing. I'm not entirely sure of how I want to display these elements, but for the video I definitely want to include both screenshots (maybe around 3) and the video (maybe some gif versions: one with just the animated background and one with me in it). For both the websites, I think I can add screenshots and then include the link (I feel like it would feel off if I embedded my game into my portfolio, but I might embed the poem. It depends). Finally, the designs will just be a 2 by 2.
