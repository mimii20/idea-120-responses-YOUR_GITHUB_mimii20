Honestly, I'm not really sure but I think it would be fun to play with a concept of 'sleep paralysis demons'. Like the user is stuck to bed, you go through the steps of opening your eyes, trying to move, etc. These demons signify something (maybe a type of issue or insecurity), but you can choose to confront, be afraid, or maybe accept these issues. They all kind of interconenct with oen another, being similar to the five stages of grief? All kind of come to the same spot, users decide to go through the stages in whichever steps they want. Maybe at the end, they wake up or something and it turns the room light (maybe with color) instead of being the dark with white contrast I thought of for the demon section.
