 1) Are the rules set up solely by the creator/developer-- or does the player also have a say in them?
 2) Can you use games such as SimCity as a sort of learning tool (ie. Urban planning) for skills?
 3) Are there any issues with replicating/creating folk games into modern machines (ie. Copyright, etc)?

I will be answering question two:    
After reading through, I do believe that games can be used as a learning tool. First and foremost, there isn't a strict definition to what constitutes as a game. A game can be something you can lean back and relax with to something that can help you learn a language (among many other skills). In this case, I feel like using games as learning tools can be very beneficial. Games are things you are oftentime invested in, whether that be emotionally or for pleasure. This means there's a motivation in playing it, thus resulting in a motivation for learn.    

A lot of people, when learning more complex topics such as engineering or even coding, can find it a hassle to sift through page after page filled with complex terms half of the population doesn't understand. When a game is used, this means data behind a topic is more readily accessible to a wider audience (it can also be much more cheaper than the textbooks higher-level education requires you to purchase).
