 1) Are the rules set up solely by the creator/developer-- or does the player also have a say in them?
 2) Can you use games such as SimCity as a sort of learning tool (ie. Urban planning)?
 3) Are there any issues with replicating/creating folk games into modern machines (ie. Copyright, etc)?

I will be answering question two:
