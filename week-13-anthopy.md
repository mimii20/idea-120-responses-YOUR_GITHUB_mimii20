 1) Are the rules set up solely by the creator/developer-- or does the player also have a say in them?
 2) Can you use games such as SimCity as a sort of learning tool (ie. Urban planning) for skills?
 3) Are there any issues with replicating/creating folk games into modern machines (ie. Copyright, etc)?

I will be answering question (2):    
After reading through, I do believe that games can be used as a learning tool. First and foremost, there isn't a strict definition to what constitutes as a game. A game can be something you can lean back and relax with to something that can help you learn a language (among many other skills). In this case, I feel like using games as learning tools can be very beneficial. Games are things you are oftentime invested in, whether that be emotionally or for pleasure. This means there's a motivation in playing it, thus resulting in a motivation for learn.    

A lot of people, when learning more complex topics such as engineering or even coding, can find it a hassle to sift through page after page filled with complex terms half of the population doesn't understand. When a game is used, this means information behind a topic is more readily accessible to a wider audience (it can also be much more cheaper than the plethora of textbooks higher-level education requires you to purchase at your own expense). For example, I remember using games to learn how to type on a keyboard without looking and how to code during middle school. Had I just been learning these topics on my own, I most likely would have gotten frustrated and dropped it after a couple of failures. Yet, a game gives me a motivation to come back because 1) it's fun and 2) it doesn't feel like studying or writing an essay-- it feels like playing a game!    

I feel like with the implentation of games into places of education, the shift of viewing studying and learning as a hassle will shfit to one of joy and fun. Furthermore, a lot fo jobs require experience now-a-days. Although you may not be able to put game playing into your resume, you can gain valuable skills from it. For example, while a stimulation may not cover all possible scenarios-- it will still be pretty faithful to the real thing. If you can figure out how to solve issues in a stimulation, you're then set for when issues arise in real life. This will put you at an advantage when compared to your peers! All in all, I firmly believe that games can be used as a learning tool for a variety of different skills.
