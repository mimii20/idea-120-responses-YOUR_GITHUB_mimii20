First, this image is of a woman with what can be considered by some a very masculine body. While societies (such as the liberal US) are more welcoming and even uplift woman who look like this-- there are also societies that are much more conservative, and the men of those society feel threatened by seeing a woman appear so powerful. This causes the reception of the image to be extremely different. Conservative, cool (?) societies are not used to seeing such an image (especially of a powerful woman), so they feel revolted and disturbed by it.   

But, I have seen first hand how the reaction towards this influencer in particular has changed from medium to medium. I've noticed that this influencer is mostly on instagram, yet I found her on twitter. There was a picture of her from a upward angle, holding her hand out towards the screen and showing off her muscles. People on twitter were absolutely IN LOVE with the picture, sharing it around and even creating an art trend with their favorites posing in said pose. Meanwhile, I look at her instagram and the comments are more tame (though still very much uplifting). The reaction from the audiences is most definitely different and it's like twitter doesn't mind going absolutely crazy over a woman with muscles compared to the more tame, instagram users.

First and foremost, the female influencer in the picture (which is technically advertising workout clothes) is not being sexualized in any way. On the contrary, the focus of the image is on her abdomen, which clearly shows off a six pack (something that can be seen as strong or even "masculine", which it's not, sometimes). Furthermore, the angle of the picture plays a big part in the sense of empowerment as well, since it makes the viewers feel like they're looking up at the influencer. If the image had been pointed downwards, this would have been a completely different story. The expression that the influencer has on her face is also another important component. She doesn't appear to look shy or scared-- it looks like she's feeling herself and her fit body in the clothes she is wearing. She is confident. All of these things come together to portray a confident, very fit and muscular, woman rocking workout clothes.
