# The Rules of the Game
   
Rules are written to be followed, and I shall follow   
I invite you to play this game, though    
The realm we play it in is far and wide    
Be Not Afraid, as it holds many secrets for you and I 
**And these secrets may be expressed in ways so all who breathe can understand.**
