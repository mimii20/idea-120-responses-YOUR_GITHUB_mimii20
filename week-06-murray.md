Well, the first difference I noticed between Murray's words and the concept depicted in the video was the fact that in our current world, we (as the viewers) are unable to interact with the screen. The LED screen makes it so that the ACTORS can interact with their environment and thus make the things being filmed seem more realistic. As the viewers of this interaction, we cannot deep dive into the environment the actors are in just yet. We can, theoretically, become more immersed and believe we are right there with them if the methods of filming and backdrops become more realistic-- but we can't exactly feel like we are in that story world just yet (such as being able to grab an object like a newspaper-- courtesy of Murray). I think we can get to that level one day in film production, which we have definitely seen through VR and the newest apple technology, but to make it widely accesible will take some time.
