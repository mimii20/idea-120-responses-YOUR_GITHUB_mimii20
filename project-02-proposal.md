I'm not completely sure on what exactly I want my project to be, but I do have a couple of ideas in mind. I feel like the lofi (you know the one one youtube with the girl reading and listening to music) would be fun. If not, maybe a background from a video game could work (I know Mihoyo games have really pretty backgrounds and art pieces). Those are my main two ideas as of now. I just need to choose.
