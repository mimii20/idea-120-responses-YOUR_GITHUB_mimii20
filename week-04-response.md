First, this image

As for the message, I think it really drives home a sense of empowerment. First and foremost, the female influencer in the picture (which is technically advertising workout clothes) is not being sexualized in any way. On the contrary, the focus of the image is on her abdomen, which clearly shows off a six pack (something that can be seen as strong or even "masculine", which it's not, sometimes). Furthermore, the angle of the picture plays a big part in the sense of empowerment as well, since it makes the viewers feel like they're looking up at the influencer. If the image had been pointed downwards, this would have been a completely different story. The expression that the influencer has on her face is also another important component. She doesn't appear to look shy or scared-- it looks like she's feeling herself and her fit body in the clothes she is wearing. She is confident. All of these things come together to portray a confident, very fit and muscular, woman rocking workout clothes.
