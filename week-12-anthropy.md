  I personally feel like coding is such a big deterrment for a lot of people. Sometimes I look at coding and I'm like: I want to do this, but coding this two second thing takes 80 different steps that I don't know how to tackle yet. That's the thought process of someone who take APCSP. Now imagine how someone who has zero coding background must feel when they're told to code? This is why programs, such as the ones mentioned in the Anthropy reading are so important. If someone doesn't know how to code, there are programs with simplified coding or coding already done for you so you can achieve your artistic endeavors! Furthermore, people need a stepping into the world of coding since it's so intimidating. Without it, I think many people would not try coding.    
  
  The good thing about the modern world is that there are so many resources available. As long as you have access to youtube or even reddit (I know), there is someone out there who has a tutorial. This helps both experienced coders tackle an issue they're facing or people who come from poverished backgrounds, who would never have the resources otherwise to try out coding. This then allows people from all backgrounds to add their input into the gaming world. This is important because a lot of these voices are often marginalized and silenced. Through games and game creation, we could hear hidden stories and thus better understand the struggles, stories, and woes of people who are different to us.
