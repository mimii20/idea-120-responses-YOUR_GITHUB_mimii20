I think, like O'Neil had mentioned-- it's extremely important to be able to visualize what all of these numbers mean. When it's a bar graph or just dots on a graph connected by a line, it can be difficult to understand the significance of what the data is meant to represent. Yet, when you present the data that any person with any background can understand, then it makes it 1) more accessible/readily available and 2)much more clear in what the impact of ignoring or aiding this data could cause. If you tell me to tell you how much a liter is, I wouldn't be able to immediately tell you, resulting in me not really thinking much about what a liter of something truly means. On the other hand, if you show me a picture or visual representation of a liter then I WILL be able to understand and thus then be able to use that information properly. Not allowing data to be readily accessible to all forms of audiences feels very strange to me.   
   
To add on to this-- not everyone is a fan of math, is good at it, or comes from a background of math. I'm not particularly a fan of math and have very much been guilty of being afraid or intimidated by the idea of numbers. Yet, as Chalabi has stated-- we shouldn't be afraid of math and should instead try to confront it. If we never fight authorities or try to make sense of something complicated, then that marginalizes and isolates us from those in power. By not challenging, we relinquish our rights and allow someone else (who might not have the best intentions in mind), to make choices for us. And when those choices concern whether or not we get a job or whether I'm deemed as a criminal or not-- it's important that everyone, especially those who are most likely to be affected, have a say in it.
