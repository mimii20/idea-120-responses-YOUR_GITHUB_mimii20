## Contemporary tools that can be used for the creation of Gesamtkunstwerk

When it comes to the contemporary tools and technology we have today, we are able to create Gesamtkunstwerk (or the total artwork) with much more ease. A century ago, we were stumped by the technology back then. Alas, as time passed, we began to see the use of 3-Dimensional objects instead of flat paintings for operatic/thearte pieces. They would also take care to place objects on stage purposefully, plan for a certain texture, use light to their advantage, and constructed props in a manner that would benefit their cause. This is still true today.   

As a result of technology, what they tried to implement before, can be implemented more easily. Some of these plays rely on sci-fi, futuristic ideas, and with the help of photoshop, body tracking, and 3D modeling, we are able to make those ideas more realistic when they're displayed on a screen. We also have the chance to more easily manipulate the light, music, settings, atmosphere, background, movement of stage components, etc of a scene. If we don't like it when it's being filmed, we can always change some things up post production.
